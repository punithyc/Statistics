# Statistics
Welcome to the Statistics repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of statistical tests, methods, and case studies implemented in Jupyter notebooks.

### Contents
**1.** __*Statistical Tests*__
This section includes detailed examples and practical implementations of common statistical tests:

Chi-Square Tests:

Chi-Square Test for Variance: Evaluates whether the variance of a population is equal to a specified value.
Chi-Square Test for Independence: Determines the independence between categorical variables.
Z-Tests:

One-Sample Z-Test: Tests whether the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.
Two-Sample Z-Test: Compares the means of two independent samples.
Two-Proportion Z-Test: Compares the proportions of two groups.
T-Tests:

One-Sample T-Test: Tests whether the mean of a sample differs from a known value.
Paired T-Test: Compares means of two related groups.
Two-Sample T-Test (Equal and Unequal Variances): Compares means of two independent groups with options for equal or unequal variances.
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):

One-Way ANOVA: Compares means across multiple groups to assess significant differences.
Test for Equality of Variances:

Evaluates whether two or more groups have equal variances.
2. Case Studies
The repository features practical case studies to demonstrate real-world applications of statistical tests:

Insurance Case Study:
Explores the use of statistical tests for analyzing customer behavior and claims data.
Mobile Internet Case Study:
Applies statistical methods to evaluate trends and usage patterns.
NEP Case Study (Chi-Square Test):
Analyzes categorical data to test for independence.
Red Wine Statistical Analysis:
Performs statistical evaluation of wine quality data.
Titan Insurance Case Study:
Uses statistical techniques to assess insurance data trends.
