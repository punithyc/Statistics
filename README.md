# Statistics
Welcome to the Statistics repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of statistical tests, methods, and case studies implemented in Jupyter notebooks.

### Contents
**1.** __*Statistical Tests :*__ <br>
This section includes detailed examples and practical implementations of common statistical tests:<br>

**a.** __*Chi-Square Tests:*__ <br>

* __*Chi-Square Test for Variance:*__ Evaluates whether the variance of a population is equal to a specified value. <br>
* __*Chi-Square Test for Independence:*__ Determines the independence between categorical variables. <br>

**b.** __*Z-Tests:*__ <br>

* __*One-Sample Z-Test:*__ Tests whether the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean. <br>
* __*Two-Sample Z-Test:*__ Compares the means of two independent samples. <br>
* __*Two-Proportion Z-Test:*__ Compares the proportions of two groups. <br>

**c.** __*T-Tests:*__ <br>

* __*One-Sample T-Test:*__ Tests whether the mean of a sample differs from a known value. <br>
* __*Paired T-Test:*__ Compares means of two related groups. <br>
* __*Two-Sample T-Test (Equal and Unequal Variances):*__ Compares means of two independent groups with options for equal or unequal variances. <br>

**d.** __*Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):*__ <br>

* __*One-Way ANOVA:*__ Compares means across multiple groups to assess significant differences. <br>
* __*Test for Equality of Variances:*__ Evaluates whether two or more groups have equal variances. <br>

__*2. Case Studies*__ <br>
The repository features practical case studies to demonstrate real-world applications of statistical tests: <br>

**a.** __*Insurance Case Study:*__ <br>
Explores the use of statistical tests for analyzing customer behavior and claims data. <br>
**b.** __*Mobile Internet Case Study:*__ <br>
Applies statistical methods to evaluate trends and usage patterns. <br>
**c.** __*NEP Case Study (Chi-Square Test):*__ <br>
Analyzes categorical data to test for independence. <br>
**d.** __*Red Wine Statistical Analysis:*__ <br>
Performs statistical evaluation of wine quality data. <br>
**e.** __*Titan Insurance Case Study:*__ <br>
Uses statistical techniques to assess insurance data trends. <br>
