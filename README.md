# Statistics
Welcome to the Statistics repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of statistical tests, methods, and case studies implemented in Jupyter notebooks.

### Contents
**1.** __*Statistical Tests :*__
This section includes detailed examples and practical implementations of common statistical tests:

__*Chi-Square Tests:*__

__*Chi-Square Test for Variance:*__ Evaluates whether the variance of a population is equal to a specified value.
__*Chi-Square Test for Independence:*__ Determines the independence between categorical variables.
__*Z-Tests:*__

__*One-Sample Z-Test:*__ Tests whether the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.
__*Two-Sample Z-Test:*__ Compares the means of two independent samples.
__*Two-Proportion Z-Test:*__ Compares the proportions of two groups.
__*T-Tests:*__

__*One-Sample T-Test:*__ Tests whether the mean of a sample differs from a known value.
__*Paired T-Test:*__ Compares means of two related groups.
__*Two-Sample T-Test (Equal and Unequal Variances):*__ Compares means of two independent groups with options for equal or unequal variances.
__*Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):*__

__*One-Way ANOVA:*__ Compares means across multiple groups to assess significant differences.
__*Test for Equality of Variances:*__

Evaluates whether two or more groups have equal variances.
__*2. Case Studies*__
The repository features practical case studies to demonstrate real-world applications of statistical tests:

__*Insurance Case Study:*__
Explores the use of statistical tests for analyzing customer behavior and claims data.
__*Mobile Internet Case Study:*__
Applies statistical methods to evaluate trends and usage patterns.
__*NEP Case Study (Chi-Square Test):*__
Analyzes categorical data to test for independence.
__*Red Wine Statistical Analysis:*__
Performs statistical evaluation of wine quality data.
__*Titan Insurance Case Study:*__
Uses statistical techniques to assess insurance data trends.
